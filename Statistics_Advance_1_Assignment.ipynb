        "###Q2 What are the types of random variables?\n",
        "There are two main types of random variables:\n",
        "1. **Discrete Random Variable**: It takes countable values like 0, 1, 2, 3, etc.\n",
        "2. **Continuous Random Variable**: It can take any value within a given range like 2.5, 3.14, 7.01, etc.\n",

        "###Q5 How do cumulative distribution functions (CDF) differ from probability distribution functions (PDF)?\n",
        "A **PDF** gives the probability of a random variable falling within a range, while a **CDF** gives the probability that a random variable is less than or equal to a certain value. CDF adds up the probabilities from the PDF.\n",

        "###Q9 What is the Poisson distribution and where is it applied?\n",
        "A **Poisson distribution** is used to predict how many times an event will happen in a fixed time or area. It is applied when events occur randomly and independently, like the number of phone calls in an hour.\n",

        "\n",
        "###Q10 What is a continuous uniform distribution?\n",

        "###Q12 What is the standard normal distribution, and why is it important?\n",
        "A **standard normal distribution** is a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. It is important because it simplifies calculations and comparisons in statistics using Z-scores.\n",

        "The **Central Limit Theorem** states that the distribution of the sample mean will be approximately normal, regardless of the shape of the population, if the sample size is large enough. It is critical because it allows us to make predictions and conduct tests using normal distribution formulas.\n",
